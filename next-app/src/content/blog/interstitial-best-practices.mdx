## The Double-Edged Sword of Interstitial Ads

Interstitial ads can be your highest-earning ad format or your biggest user retention killer. The difference lies entirely in implementation.

## When to Show Interstitials

### Good Timing

- Between game levels
- After completing a task
- When navigating between major sections
- After natural content breaks

### Bad Timing

- Immediately on app launch
- During active user engagement
- Multiple times in quick succession
- When user is mid-action

## Frequency Best Practices

| App Type | Recommended Frequency |
|----------|----------------------|
| Casual Games | Every 2-3 levels |
| Utility Apps | Every 3-4 actions |
| Content Apps | Every 4-5 articles |
| Productivity | Minimal or none |

## User Experience Tips

1. **Preload ads**: Ensure instant display without loading delays
2. **Clear close buttons**: Make dismissal easy and obvious
3. **Skip options**: Consider offering skip after 5 seconds
4. **Frequency caps**: Limit to 3-4 per session maximum

## Measuring Success

Track these metrics to ensure healthy implementation:

- **Session length**: Should remain stable or increase
- **Day 1/7/30 retention**: Monitor for negative trends
- **App store ratings**: Watch for ad-related complaints
- **eCPM trends**: Higher isn't always better if users leave

## Conclusion

Interstitial ads require careful balance. Prioritize user experience, and the revenue will follow sustainably.
