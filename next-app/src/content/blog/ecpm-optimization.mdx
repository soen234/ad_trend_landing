## What is eCPM and Why Does It Matter?

eCPM (effective Cost Per Mille) represents how much you earn per 1,000 ad impressions. Optimizing eCPM is crucial for maximizing ad revenue without increasing traffic.

## Key Optimization Strategies

### 1. Mediation Setup

Use ad mediation to maximize fill rates and competition:

- **AdMob Mediation**: Great for beginners, easy setup
- **AppLovin MAX**: Advanced features, higher eCPM potential
- **ironSource**: Strong for gaming apps

### 2. Waterfall Optimization

Configure your waterfall to prioritize high-paying networks:

1. Set initial floor prices based on historical data
2. Order networks by average eCPM
3. Include a catch-all network at the bottom
4. Review and adjust weekly

### 3. A/B Testing

Continuously test and optimize:

- Ad placements and timing
- Frequency caps
- Ad format mix
- Floor prices

## Quick Wins

| Strategy | Expected Impact |
|----------|-----------------|
| Add 2-3 mediation networks | +20-30% eCPM |
| Optimize floor prices | +10-15% eCPM |
| Implement smart refresh | +15-25% revenue |
| Add rewarded ads | +40-60% total revenue |

## Conclusion

eCPM optimization is an ongoing process. Start with the basics, measure everything, and continuously iterate for the best results.
