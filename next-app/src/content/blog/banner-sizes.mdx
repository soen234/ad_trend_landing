## Understanding Mobile Banner Ad Sizes

Choosing the right banner size can significantly impact your ad revenue. Let's dive into the most common mobile banner formats and their performance characteristics.

## Standard Banner Sizes

### 320x50 (Mobile Banner)

The most common mobile banner size, appearing at the top or bottom of the screen.

- **Pros**: Non-intrusive, high fill rate, works on all devices
- **Cons**: Lower eCPM due to smaller size
- **Best for**: Apps requiring constant ad visibility without disrupting UX

### 300x250 (Medium Rectangle)

A larger, more prominent banner that typically appears within content.

- **Pros**: Higher eCPM, better engagement, more creative space
- **Cons**: More intrusive, requires dedicated placement
- **Best for**: Content feeds, between sections, natural breaks

### 320x100 (Large Mobile Banner)

Double the height of standard banners, offering more visibility.

- **Pros**: Higher CTR than 320x50, still relatively non-intrusive
- **Cons**: Takes more screen real estate
- **Best for**: Premium placements, high-value screens

### Adaptive Banners

Automatically adjusts to the device's screen width for optimal display.

- **Pros**: Perfect fit on any device, higher fill rates
- **Cons**: Less predictable layout
- **Best for**: New apps, cross-device experiences

## Performance Comparison

| Size | Avg eCPM | CTR | Fill Rate |
|------|----------|-----|-----------|
| 320x50 | $0.50-1.00 | 0.3% | 95%+ |
| 300x250 | $2.00-4.00 | 0.8% | 85% |
| 320x100 | $1.00-2.00 | 0.5% | 90% |
| Adaptive | $1.50-3.00 | 0.6% | 95%+ |

## Best Practices

1. **Test multiple sizes**: A/B test different banner sizes in your app
2. **Consider context**: Use larger banners in content-rich areas
3. **Monitor metrics**: Track both revenue and user experience metrics
4. **Refresh wisely**: Implement smart refresh intervals (30-60 seconds)

## Conclusion

The best banner size depends on your app's layout and user experience priorities. Start with adaptive banners for flexibility, then optimize based on your specific performance data.
